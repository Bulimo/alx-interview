## Task to solve

    The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic
    removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

    Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from
    1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and
    removing that number and its multiples from the set.
    The player that cannot make a move loses the game.
    determine who the winner of each game is.
